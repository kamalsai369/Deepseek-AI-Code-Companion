### **🔧 How It Works**

1. **AI-Powered Prompt Chain:**  
   - Leverages `ChatPromptTemplate` to dynamically build prompts based on the conversation.  
   - Ensures the context is preserved for better responses.  

2. **Customizable LLM Engine:**  
   - Uses `ChatOllama` with a temperature of `0.3` for concise, strategic solutions.  

3. **Session State Management:**  
   - Tracks the message history for seamless user experience.  

4. **Custom Styling with CSS:**  
   - Dark mode theme to reduce eye strain and improve focus.

### **💡 What's Next?**  
- 🌐 Expand support for additional programming languages.  
- 🤖 Integrate with external debugging tools (e.g., PyLint, Black).  
- 📊 Add visualization features for data structures and flow diagrams.  
- 🎨 More UI themes and configurations.
